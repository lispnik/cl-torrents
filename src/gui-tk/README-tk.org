To build it:

: make build-gui

and run it:

: ./torrents-tk &

POC TODOs:

- [X] display results in a treeview <2019-02-24 dim.>
  feedback: very quick to do (couple  hours for a noob), great support
  from nodgui's author.
- [ ] menu bar
- see magnet link in a popup window => just open or dl for now.
- [X] open the url of the selection in a browser <2019-03-13 mer.>

And then:

- [ ] copy magnet link to clipboard
- [ ] sort columns
- [ ] option: bypass cache
- [ ] make numbers stick to the right

BUGS:

- [ ] "latin capital letter"  error, for example when searching "tears
  of steel"
- [X] UI glitch: the searchbox goes under the button. fixed: don't use
  columnspan but :sticky east/west.
- [ ] UI glitch: the resize doesn't expand the bottom.


Thoughts:

it's fun :)

easily discoverable.

it's possible to  interactively build the UI from the  repl, button by button O_o
